# API key usage: metering and recharge

## The problem this solves

Mission Control provisions a clone by replicating the prime repo's Supabase
architecture onto a fresh project — migrations, edge functions, and the *secret
names* those functions read. For a whitelisted subset of those names
(`prime_secret_forwards.inherit = true`) it also forwards the prime's **real
key values**, because a secret shell makes every consumer 500 on its first call.

That is deliberate and it is what lets a clone work on day one. It also means a
clone spends **our** money from its first request: its OpenAI tokens, Resend
emails, Domain lookups and AML verifications are billed to the prime's vendor
accounts. Until now none of that was attributable to the tenant that caused it.

This system meters it and recharges it — and charges nothing for a key the
clone supplies itself.

## The billability rule

There is exactly one input, and nobody sets it by hand. It is
`clone_backend_secrets.status`, which provisioning writes and the operator "set
secret value" action updates:

| status | meaning | billed |
|---|---|---|
| `inherited` | provisioning forwarded our key onto the clone | **yes** |
| `set` | the clone/operator wrote its own key | no — BYOK |
| `missing` | no key landed on the clone | no |
| `failed` | the secret sync errored | no |
| *(no row)* | we never lent this clone this key | no — and it is flagged |

The last row matters. An event we cannot tie to a key we lent is recorded and
surfaced as `unknown_secret`, never charged. **We do not bill on a guess.** At
volume it means the prime's reporter is sending a name the provisioner does not
know, which is a bug to fix rather than spend to collect.

Two more outcomes are free by design: a call the vendor rejected (`error_call` —
charging for nothing delivered is indefensible on an invoice), and a key we
forward as platform overhead rather than tenant usage (`not_billable`, e.g.
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).

The rule lives in two places, on purpose:

- `public.resolve_api_key_billability(clone_id, secret_name)` — used inside the
  ingest transaction, because the lookup and the rollup update must be atomic.
- `src/lib/api-usage-rating.ts` → `resolveBillingReason()` — the same rule,
  pure, pinned by `api-usage-rating.test.ts`. Change one, change both.

## Why the secret name is the key

`secret_name` is the only identifier shared by all three parties:

- the prime's edge functions read it from `Deno.env.get("…")`,
- `prime_secret_forwards` whitelists it for forwarding,
- `clone_backend_secrets` records whose key is behind it on each clone.

A provider slug is not good enough: `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
are the same vendor and separate bills.

## Money

Rates are carried in **micros** — 1e-6 of a currency unit, so 10,000 micros =
1 cent. Per-token prices sit far below a cent (AUD 0.0000006 per Gemini Flash
input token); in cents they round to zero and the meter would read free forever.

Micros become cents **once**, on the settled period total — never per line. A
thousand sub-cent calls would each round to nothing and bill as zero.

## The tables

| table | what it is |
|---|---|
| `api_provider_rates` | the price list, one row per secret name: unit, our cost, resale rate, free allowance per period, billable flag |
| `api_usage_events` | every reported call with its rating decision and reason — the answer to a disputed invoice |
| `api_usage_rollups` | `(tenant, period, secret)` totals, maintained inside the ingest transaction so it cannot drift from the events |
| `api_usage_charges` | one settled charge per tenant-period; immutable once closed |
| `api_usage_charge_lines` | the per-secret detail behind a charge |

Rollups and charges are the billing record and are kept indefinitely. Raw events
are purged at 400 days (`purge_api_usage_events`) — longer than any plausible
dispute window plus a year-on-year comparison.

## The flow

```
prime edge function
  → logApiUsage()                    writes api_usage_log (fire-and-forget)
  → report-api-usage worker (cron)   drains it in batches of 200
  → POST /api/public/usage/report    x-clone-api-key, scope usage:report
  → record_api_usage_event()         rates each event, updates the rollup
  → close_api_usage_period()         applies the free allowance, micros → cents
  → Stripe invoice item              rides on the tenant's next invoice
```

### Ingest

`POST /api/public/usage/report`, scope `usage:report`, batches of up to 200:

```jsonc
{
  "tenant_ref": "prime:abcdefgh",
  "display_name": "Naidu Property",
  "events": [
    {
      "secret_name": "OPENAI_API_KEY",   // the Deno.env name, not a vendor slug
      "quantity": 1500,                   // tokens, emails, lookups — per the rate's unit
      "idempotency_key": "<api_usage_log row id>",
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "feature": "/v1/chat/completions",
      "status": "success",                // "error" is metered, never charged
      "occurred_at": "2026-08-07T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Every event gets its own outcome, and a malformed one does not cost the other
199 their delivery:

```jsonc
{
  "ok": true, "accepted": 199, "rejected": 1, "billable": 140,
  "results": [{ "idempotency_key": "…", "ok": true, "billable": true,
                "billing_reason": "inherited", "duplicate": false }]
}
```

Idempotency is on `(tenant_id, idempotency_key)`: a retried batch returns the
original rating rather than charging twice.

### Settlement

A period closes only once it has **ended** — closing an open cycle would bill
half a month and freeze the rollups the rest of it needs. `hooks/api-usage-settle`
runs the sweep on cron (Bearer `DRIFT_REFRESH_TOKEN`, like the other hooks); the
manual path is Billing → API Usage → Charges.

Closing is idempotent: re-closing a closed period returns it untouched. Invoicing
is idempotent three times over — an already-invoiced charge returns early, the
Stripe call carries `api-usage-charge-<id>` as its idempotency key, and the item
id is written back immediately.

Charges under `MIN_INVOICEABLE_CENTS` (50c) close, are marked invoiced with
`below_threshold`, and never reach Stripe: reconciling them costs more than they
collect.

### An invoice item is not a bill

A Stripe **invoice item** is a pending line waiting for an invoice to attach
itself to. Stripe attaches pending items on its own **only** when a subscription
cycle renews. So a settled charge needs one of two treatments, and picking wrong
is silent — an orphaned invoice item never errors, it just never gets collected:

| tenant | what happens | why |
|---|---|---|
| has a live subscription | item left pending | it rides the next cycle invoice as an extra line, which is what "an additional charge for API key usage" should look like on a statement. Raising our own as well would bill the same usage twice |
| no subscription | standalone invoice raised **and finalised** | no cycle will ever sweep the item up |

The second case is the normal one today, not an edge case: the Aurixa Stripe
account has no subscriptions at all. `planCollection()` in
`src/lib/api-usage-rating.ts` owns the decision and is unit-tested, because the
three outcomes are "billed once", "billed twice" and "never billed".

**Finalising** is what turns a draft into a bill — it assigns the invoice
number, mints the hosted page and the PDF, and lets Stripe collect. The invoice
is created with `auto_advance: false` and finalised as a separate explicit step,
so it cannot be emailed before its lines are confirmed, and with
`pending_invoice_items_behavior: "include"` so the item we just created is
actually swept onto it — without that, Stripe raises an empty invoice and leaves
the item pending, which is the exact failure this is here to prevent.

### Receipts

Receipts are never created — not here, not anywhere. Stripe emits them itself
when a payment succeeds, if receipt emails are enabled on the account. There is
no API that makes one, and nothing in this repo should try. The checkout path
already passes `receipt_email` and enables `invoice_creation`, so a product
purchase produces both an invoice and a receipt without any help from us.

`api_usage_uncollected_charges()` lists charges that reached an invoice item but
no invoice after a full cycle plus slack. Empty is the healthy state; anything
in it is correctly-metered revenue that is not being collected.

Waiving a charge never edits the meter. Events and rollups stay exactly as
reported; the waiver is recorded with who and why, so a written-off month still
reconciles against usage. A charge already on a Stripe invoice cannot be waived
here — that credit belongs in Stripe, or our record and the customer's statement
disagree.

## Repricing is not retroactive

`api_usage_events.rated_micros` is stamped at ingest. A rate changed today
cannot rewrite what a tenant was quoted last week. Every edit to
`api_provider_rates` is written to the audit log with before and after.

## The seeded catalog

Seeded from a scan of all 412 edge functions in `npc-property-dashbord` for
`Deno.env.get("…")`. Config values, feature flags, internal HMACs and the
Supabase-injected names are deliberately absent — they cost nothing and charging
for them would be indefensible.

Metered and billable: Lovable AI Gateway, OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity,
OpenRouter, Gemini, Google AI, Resend, Microsoft Graph, Domain, Cotality,
Airtable, Firecrawl, Google Maps, Vapi, Gamma, API2PDF, WeasyPrint, PDF parse,
DocuSign, AML verification, GoHighLevel (×2), ManyChat, Meta Ads.

Metered, not billable: Turnstile, Cloudflare API, Figma, MCP — platform
overhead, not tenant usage.

The migration also seeds `prime_secret_forwards` for the billable keys **except**
the ones that are per-tenant by nature — Microsoft Graph, GoHighLevel, DocuSign,
Meta Ads, ManyChat, Airtable. A shared credential there would cross-contaminate
mailboxes, CRM locations and signing identities between agencies. Those are
metered when an operator sets a shared key deliberately, and BYOK otherwise.

Opening rates are positions for an operator to tune in Billing → API Usage, not
fixed prices.

## Where things fail quietly, and what surfaces them

Two failure modes cost real money without erroring:

- `rate_missing` — a key nobody catalogued. Metered at zero.
- `unknown_secret` — a clone reporting a key provisioning never recorded lending it.

Both are counted on the "Metered but not billable" card on `/billing/api-usage`
rather than left in the tail of an events table nobody opens. A third —
`usage:report` missing from a clone's API key — meters *nothing at all*, which
is why that scope is on by default for newly-issued keys.
